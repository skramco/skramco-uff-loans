# Logo Update Instructions

The navigation has been updated to display the logo icon alongside the "HomeLoanAgents" text.

## Current Setup:
- Logo location: `public/logo-icon.png`
- The logo icon is displayed at 56px (14 x 4) on desktop and 48px (12 x 4) on mobile
- The text "HomeLoanAgents" appears to the right of the logo

## To Update Logo:
Replace `public/logo-icon.png` with the new logo image:
- The new logo should be the icon-only version (house with person and sparkles)
- Recommended size: 512x512 or larger (will be scaled automatically)
- Format: PNG with transparent background preferred

The current file uses the first logo you provided. To use the second logo image you shared, simply save it as `public/logo-icon.png`.
